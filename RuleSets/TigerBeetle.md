# Tiger Beetle

# Description

Tiger Beetle has a suggested style that incorporates NASA's Power of 10.
The main thing they go over is coding style that they have named `Tiger Style`.
NASA's Power of 10 did go over some aspect of coding style, but to fit in 10 rules it only went over what mattered.
Things like keeping functions small, naming at lowest scope, and using a simple control flow.
Tiger Style goes a little deeper like suggesting a naming convention and how to assertions.

Personally I like their suggestion of snake_case, but not so much for everything.
I personally use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE/snake_case for variables, camelCase for functions, and PascalCase for objects/structs to create a clear distinction.
Perhaps this is too complex, but it works for my personal code.
What is important though is that the style for the group is consistent.
