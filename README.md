# Presenting Secure Programming

## Description

These are my little secure programming practices show cases (at least should be I've only just started :P).
Basically a little repo to help explain why some practices exist and why some behaviors are bad.
Some are explaining vulnerabilities and some are best practices.
I understand that security is pretty difficult to implement correctly. There are so many tiny
things you have to get right, and only one mistake to ruin it all.

For the most part it focuses more on C as I feel people are not taught it properly, but
I'll have some stuff not strictly for C like SQL injections.
Universities may not teach some of these vulnerabilities. To be honest, you're simply
coding for the autograder. However, knowing about these vulnerabilities helps you be a better programmer
in the long run.

Each of these show cases will have their own README to help explain their vulnerbilities in more detail.
As well as the sources used.

## Common Things You'll see

I dunno yet, I'll have to get to it
