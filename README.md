# Presenting Secure Programming

## Description

This is my little secure programming encyclopedia with what ever I have done when you read this.
Basically a little repo to help explain why some practices exist, why some behaviors are bad, and how things work.
I understand that security is pretty difficult to implement correctly.
There are so many tiny things you have to get right, and only one mistake to ruin it all.
For the most part it focuses more on C as I feel people are not taught it properly, but I'll have some stuff not strictly for C like SQL injections.
Universities may not teach some of these vulnerabilities.
To be honest, you're simply coding for the auto-grader.
However, knowing about these vulnerabilities and how systems work helps you be a better programmer in the long run.

## What Makes Something Vulnerable

The biggest revelation you can as a programmer is understanding that your code lives in a system.
I mean of course code lives in the system we have context switches, file systems, and other systems called networks, but have you thought about what that means?
The fact a process lives in the system is what leads to vulnerabilities and exploits because if the process was just itself what point would there be to exploit it.
By definition of a vulnerability it is a weakness that makes the system susceptible to attack or damage with exploits acting on vulnerabilities.
As a programmer you have to keep the idea of the system in the back of your mind and evaluate your mistakes.
That is of course if you know what mistakes exist.
In all honestly you often times don't know if your code or even IT system is vulnerable until it's too late.
This is why it's so important to try your best to get things right the first time around understanding patterns that lead to vulnerabilities.

## Little Note

I am just one human making this, so I'll make mistakes.
I also don't have knowledge of everything.
If you find any mistakes or inadequate explanations let me know, and I'll try to fix them.
