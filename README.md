# Presenting Secure Programming

## Description

This is my little secure programming encyclopedia with what ever I have done when you read this.
Basically a little repo to help explain why some practices exist, why some behaviors are bad, and how things work.
I understand that security is pretty difficult to implement correctly.
There are so many tiny things you have to get right, and only one mistake to ruin it all.
For the most part it focuses more on C as I feel people are not taught it properly, but I'll have some stuff not strictly for C like SQL injections.
Universities may not teach some of these vulnerabilities.
To be honest, you're simply coding for the auto-grader.
However, knowing about these vulnerabilities and how computers work helps you be a better programmer in the long run.

## Little Note

I am just one human making this, so I'll make mistakes.
I also don't have knowledge of everything.
If you find any mistakes or inadequate explanations let me know, and I'll try to fix them.
